In the last class, we discussed expressions like "A" x + b and learned how to solve them. Today, we are going to explore expressions like "A" x^2 + "B" x + c, which are quadratic expressions.

Let's start with the simplest quadratic expression, x squared.

For x = 1, the value is 1. For x = 2, the value is 4. Let's graph these

If we plot these values on a graph with x-values on the x-axis and the "values of the expression" on the y-axis, we get a curve of the equation: y equals x squared. This shape of the curve is called a parabola.

The point 0 comma 0 is called the vertex of the parabola. Now if we change the vertex of the parabola, the equation y equals x^2 changes to (y minus (y not)) = (x minus (x not)) whole squared.
As we move the parabola around on the coordinate plane, the equation changes as shown. This knowledge comes handy to figure out the vertex of any parabola.

One of the most important techniques in dealing with quadratic expressions is factorizing them.

Consider the equation x^2 + 5x + 6. We want to split the middle term into two parts such that their product is 6.

Six equals one times six or two times three. We see that two plus three equals five. Hence, we can write the equation as x^2 + 2x + 3x + 6. Taking out common factors, we get x times x + 2 plus 3 times x + 2. Factoring out x + 2, we get x + 2 times x + 3.

Next, consider the equation x^2 minus x minus 12. We want to split the middle term into two parts such that their product is -12 in this case.

-12 equals -1 into 6 or -2 into 6 or -3 into 4. Now, if we make it 3 into -4, we see that the sum equals -1 which was needed. Hence, we can split the middle term into two parts 3x and minus 4x. Now we can carry on as shown previously.

Now, let's consider a more complex example.
3x squared minus 5x minus 12.

We multiply the term associated with x^2 (here 3) with the constant term (here -12)
Before splitting, we multiply -12 by 3, getting -36. We then find pairs of factors of -36 that sums to -5. -4 times 9 equals -36 but sums to + 5, so, we will switch the signs.

Splitting the middle term, we write 3x^2 + 4x minus 9x minus 12. Then we take out common and factorize as shown earlier.

Another important aspect of quadratics is completing the square.

We use the identity: a + b whole squared equals a^2 + 2 a b + b^2.

Consider the expression x^2 + 5x + 6. 
Rewrite the middle term by dividing and multiplying by 2 to make it similar to 2 "A" "B"
To complete the square, we add and subtract the (5 by 2 squared). 
This equals x + (5 by 2) whole squared,  minus 25 by 4 + 6. 
Simplifying, we get x + 5 over 2 whole squared minus 1 over 4. 
Can you identify the vertex of the parabola using this equation?
Using the identity a^2 minus b^2 = a minus b times a + b, we can further factorize the above equation to x + 3 times x + 2.

While lengthy, this method always works and handles non-factorizable quadratics as well. We will discuss more about this in the upcoming videos.
