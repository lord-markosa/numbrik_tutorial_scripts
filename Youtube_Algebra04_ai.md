**Quadratic Expressions Tutorial**

**Introduction:**
In the last class, we discussed expressions like \(ax + b\) and learned how to solve these. Today, we are going to explore expressions like \(ax^2 + bx + c\), which are quadratic expressions.

**Simple Quadratic Expression:**
Let's start with the simplest quadratic expression: \(x^2\).

-   For \(x = 0\), the value is 0.
-   For \(x = 1\), the value is 1.
-   For \(x = -1\), the value is 1.
-   For \(x = 2\), the value is 4.
-   For \(x = -2\), the value is 4.

If we plot these values on a graph (with \(x\)-values on the x-axis and the values of the expression on the y-axis), we get a shape like this:
\[ y = x^2 \]

This shape of the curve is called a **parabola**.

**Vertex of the Parabola:**
The point (0, 0) is called the vertex of the parabola. Now, if we change the vertex of the parabola, the equation \(y = x^2\) changes to \((y - y_0) = (x - x_0)^2\).

**Factorizing Quadratic Expressions:**
One of the most important techniques in dealing with quadratic expressions is factorizing them.

**General Form:**
\[ x^2 + bx + c \]
can be written in the form:
\[ (x + p)(x + q) \]
where \(p + q = b\) and \(p \times q = c\).

**Example 1:**
Consider the equation \(x^2 + 5x + 6\).

We want to split the middle term into two parts such that their product is 6. Let's factorize 6:
\[ 6 = 1 \times 6 \]
\[ 6 = 2 \times 3 \]

We see that \(2 + 3\) equals 5. Hence, we can write the equation as:
\[ x^2 + 2x + 3x + 6 \]

Next, we take out the common factors from the first and second terms, and from the third and fourth terms:
\[ x(x + 2) + 3(x + 2) \]

We notice that \(x + 2\) is common, so we factor it out:
\[ (x + 2)(x + 3) \]

**Example 2:**
Consider the equation \(8x^2 + 22x + 15\).

Before splitting, we multiply 15 by 8:
\[ 15 \times 8 = 120 \]

We then find pairs of factors of 120 that sum to 22:
\[ 120 = 1 \times 120 \]
\[ 120 = 2 \times 60 \]
\[ 120 = 3 \times 40 \]
\[ 120 = 4 \times 30 \]
\[ 120 = 5 \times 24 \]
\[ 120 = 6 \times 20 \]
\[ 120 = 8 \times 15 \]
\[ 120 = 10 \times 12 \]

We see that \(10 + 12\) equals 22. Hence, we split the middle term:
\[ 8x^2 + 12x + 10x + 15 \]

Next, we take common factors from the first and second terms, and from the third and fourth terms:
\[ 4x(2x + 3) + 5(2x + 3) \]

We notice that \(2x + 3\) is common, so we factor it out:
\[ (2x + 3)(4x + 5) \]

**Perfect Squares:**
Another method for solving quadratics is by using perfect squares. We use the identity:
\[ (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \]

Also:
\[ (a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2 \]

**Example 3 (continued):**
We were trying to complete the square for the quadratic expression \(x^2 + 5x + 6\).

So, we write:
\[ x^2 + 2 \times \frac{5}{2} \times x \]
This looks close to a perfect square except \((\frac{5}{2})^2\) is missing. So we add and subtract \((\frac{5}{2})^2\):

\[ x^2 + 2 \times \frac{5}{2} \times x + (\frac{5}{2})^2 - (\frac{5}{2})^2 + 6 \]

Next, the first three terms can be written as a perfect square:

\[ \left( x + \frac{5}{2} \right)^2 - \left( \frac{5}{2} \right)^2 + 6 \]

Simplifying further, we get:

\[ \left( x + \frac{5}{2} \right)^2 - \frac{25}{4} + 6 \]

Converting 6 to a fraction with the same denominator:

\[ \left( x + \frac{5}{2} \right)^2 - \frac{25}{4} + \frac{24}{4} \]

Which simplifies to:

\[ \left( x + \frac{5}{2} \right)^2 - \frac{1}{4} \]

Using the difference of squares identity \((a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2\), we can factor it as follows:

\[ \left( x + \frac{5}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \right)\left( x + \frac{5}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \right) \]

Which simplifies to:

\[ (x + 3)(x + 2) \]

This is the same result we obtained earlier by factoring directly.

**Why Use Completing the Square?**
While the method of completing the square is lengthy, it is powerful because:

1. **Consistency**: It always works and doesnâ€™t require intuitively finding the right pair of factors.
1. **Versatility**: This method can handle any quadratic expression, even those that cannot be factored using simple integers or real numbers.

**Quadratics and Real Numbers:**
Sometimes quadratic expressions cannot be factored into real numbers. In such cases, completing the square or using the quadratic formula is essential.

**Quadratic Formula:**
The quadratic formula can solve any quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\):
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

**Next Steps:**
We will discuss more about solving quadratic equations and their applications in upcoming lessons. Keep practicing factorizing quadratics, completing the square, and using the quadratic formula to become proficient.
