Let‚Äôs begin with an example to illustrate the method of completing the square. Consider the expression:
x^2 + 6x + 8

As discussed earlier, we can rewrite this by completing the square. 
To do this, we take half of the coefficient of ùë•, square it, and add and subtract it within the expression.

Now, let's visualize the quadratic function. 
Completing the square gives us the vertex form. So, we know that the vertex would be at (-3, -1).
We can also see that the curve intersects the x-axis at -4 and -2.

Wherever any polynomial function y = f(x) intersects the x-axis, gives us the solution to the equation f(x) = 0. This is also referred to as roots of the equation.

How do we find the roots analytically?
Let's equate the previously obtained quadratic function to zero.
Factorize the left hand side or LHS to get (x+2) times (x+4).
Now the LHS equals zero only when x = -2 or x = -4.
Thus the roots of the equation are -2 and -4 as was seen in the graph previously.

Now, let‚Äôs see what happens when we move the graph up or down.
If we shift the function upwards, it may touch the x-axis at a single point, leading to one repeated root.
If shifted further up, the function never touches the x-axis, implying no real solutions.

Thus a quadratic equation has:
2 roots if the vertex lies below the x-axis.
1 root if the vertex lies on the x-axis.
No real roots if the vertex lies above the x-axis.

Let‚Äôs complete the square for the expression ax^2 + bx + c.
The same steps are to be followed.
Now, we can see that the vertex of this parabola is minus b by 2 "A", and this complicated term represents the Y value.
Next, lets equate the above perfect square expression to 0 and find out the values of x.
This is called the quadratic formula.

The complicated term inside the square root is same as negative of, the numerator of, the Y value of vertex. This quantity is called the discriminant. 
This determines the nature of the roots of a quadratic equation.
As square root of a negative quantity would be imaginary, there would be no real roots.
If D = 0, plus minus 0 would result in the same root.
Otherwise 2 roots exists.

Please note that "AA" decides whether the parabola is facing upwards or downwards. For real roots, if its a upward facing parabola then the vertex has to be below or on the x-axis. Else if its a downward facing parabola then the opposite must be true.

Thus, if discriminant is greater than 0, 2 solution exists.
If discriminant = 0, 1 solution exists.
And if discriminant is less than 0, no real solution exists.

To summarize, we explored completing the square, graphed quadratic equations and observed how shifting the parabola affects solutions, and derived the quadratic formula. 
These techniques provide powerful insights into solving and understanding quadratic equations.
